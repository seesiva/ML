# SwissBank notes
The Swiss bank data (see Appendix, Table B.2) consists of 200 measurements on Swiss bank notes. The first half of these measurements are from genuine bank notes, the other half are from counterfeit bank notes. These data are taken from Flury and Riedwyl (1988). The aim is to study how these measurements may be used in determining whether a bill is genuine or counterfeit.

## Attributes
X1 = length of the bill
X2 = height of the bill (left)
X3 = height of the bill (right)
X4 = distance of the inner frame to the lower border
X5 = distance of the inner frame to the upper border
X6 = length of the diagonal of the central picture.

## Fivenumber summary for X1
* n=200 and n is even
* M = 1/2 * (x(n/2)+x((n/2)+1))
* M = 1/2 * (214.9+214.9)
* M = x(100)= 214.9
