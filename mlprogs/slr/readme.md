# Simple Linear Regression
Linear regression is a statistical approach for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variables.

Regression is usually termed as determining relationship(s) between two or more variables. For example, in the above two examples, X and Y are the variables. X is termed as the independent variable and Y is termed as the dependent variable and Y has a continous range (unlike classification where Y is discrete).

## Notes
* Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning technique.

## Sample Cases
Given the following values of X and Y, what is the value of Y when X = 5.(1,1), (2,2), (4,4), (100,100), (20, 20)
The answer is : 5. Not very difficult, right?

Now, let’s take a look at different example. Say you have the following pairs of X and Y. Can you calculate the value of Y, when X = 5?
(1,1), (2,4), (4,16), (100,10000), (20, 400)

Computer looks at some examples and then tries to identify “the most suitable” relationship between the sets X and Y. Using this identified relationship, it will try to predict (or more) for new examples for which you don’t know Y.
