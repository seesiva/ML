# KNN
k-Nearest Neighbors

# Notes
It is a competitive learning algorithm
It internally uses competition between model elements (data instances) in order to make a predictive decision

## List of reasons
1. When the dimensions are limited with more number of instances
2. When there is need for finding similarity
3. Recommendation systems
4. Typically for classification problems


## Approach:
k-NN solves the problem of prediction using data instances
Training observations will be part of the model.
